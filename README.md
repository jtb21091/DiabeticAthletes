# DiabeticAthletes
A simple website, data, links and information for T1D athletes so that people can find them in one source

This is a work in progress.

Let me know if I am missing any T1D (only type 1, not type 2)

Anyone who wants to help is more than free to; just email me how you would like to help

# üèÜ Diabetic Athletes - Player Links

This project provides an easy-to-use **Player Profile Link Finder** that allows users to search for diabetic athletes and access their player profile links.
